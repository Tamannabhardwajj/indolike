Indolike Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python-based Machine Learning projects demonstrating real-world applications such as fraud detection, house price prediction, and SMS spam classification. Each project uses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to deliver accurate predictions and insights.

📂 Projects Included
Fraud Detection

Detects potentially fraudulent transactions using supervised learning techniques.

Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.

House Price Prediction

Predicts house prices based on features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other variables.

Implements regression models with performance visualizations.

SMS Spam Detection

Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate).

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification models.
